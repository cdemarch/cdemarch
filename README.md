## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christopher DeMarchi ðŸ™‚

- ðŸ’¬ About Me: I'm currently a senior at UNC Charlotte working towards my degree in Software Systems and Networking. I recently had to move to Greenville, NC which is my reasoning for taking this class entirely online. I played competitive League of Legends for the school
during my time here and was on the NECC fall winning team in my Sophomore year. During my Junior year we made it to top 8 in our group for CLOL, beating out NC State for our placement. Aside from gaming I enjoy working on my car, swimming, fishing, and have tried my hand at content creation here and there.

- ðŸ“½ Projects: My easiest to find project would be the website I made in ITIS 3135 for web design. Its a simple website that's made to show my use of links, Java scripts, HTML, and other more basic functions for webpages. 
Here is the link: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/cdemarch/ITIS3135/
Other projects I've done in the past were mainly through python as its my favorite language to use by far. Here is a seperate github account and repository I made specifically for ITSC-3155 that incldues all of my flask exercises and testing:

- ðŸŒ± Goals and Objectives: What I really want out of this class is a professional GitHub by the end of the semester. It would help me out immensly to have a professional GitHub for my resume, with more complex programs to showcase my knowledge. Most of the work through classes
so far have been pretty basic stuff in order to hammer down concepts and make sure I have the knowledge I needed to continue my degree. I want to learn more and challenge myself to build something with real world application that I can point to show my progress. I also look forward
to creating a more realistic work flow with my group members to better replicate how projects are designed, created, and adjusted in the industry today.

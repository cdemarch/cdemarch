## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Christopher DeMarchi ðŸ™‚

- ðŸ’¬ About Me: I'm a recent grad from UNC Charlotte and obtained my degree in Software Systems and Networking. I recently had to move to Greenville, NC. Aside from gaming I enjoy working on my car, swimming, fishing, and have tried my hand at content creation here and there.

- ðŸ“½ Projects: My easiest to find project would be the repositories I worked on with this Github account! There is also a website I made in ITIS 3135 for web design. Its a simple website that's made to show my use of links, Java scripts, HTML, and other more basic functions for webpages. 
Here is the link: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/cdemarch/ITIS3135/
Other projects I've done in the past were mainly through python as its my favorite language to use by far. Here is a seperate github account and repository I made specifically for ITSC-3155 that incldues all of my flask exercises and testing:

- ðŸŒ± Goals and Objectives: Now that I have recently graduated I need to begin my career. While I dont technically have any employment level experience yet, I'm very motivated and ready to learn!
